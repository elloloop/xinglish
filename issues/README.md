# Xinglish Transliteration Quality Issues

This folder contains detailed issues for fixing the poor transliteration quality and adding multi-language support to the Xinglish project.

## Issue Structure

### üî¥ Critical Issues (Fix First)

- **[Issue #0](00-master-execution-plan.md)** - Master execution plan and coordination
- **[Issue #1](01-transliteration-algorithm-overhaul.md)** - Core algorithm overhaul (CRITICAL)

### üî¥ High Priority Issues

- **[Issue #2](02-hindi-syllable-analysis.md)** - Hindi syllable analysis implementation

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

- **[Issue #3](03-telugu-language-support.md)** - Telugu language support
- **[Issue #4](04-multi-language-architecture.md)** - Multi-language architecture

### üü¢ Low Priority Issues

- **[Issue #5](05-playground-multi-language-ui.md)** - Playground UI updates

## Current Problem

The transliteration system produces unusable results:

- **Input**: "namaste"
- **Current Output**: "‡§®‡§Ö‡§Æ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§§‡§è" (letter-by-letter transliteration)
- **Expected Output**: "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á" (proper Hindi word)

## Execution Order

1. **Week 1**: Fix core Hindi algorithm (Issue #1)
2. **Week 2**: Enhance Hindi syllable analysis (Issue #2)
3. **Week 3**: Build multi-language architecture (Issue #4)
4. **Week 4**: Add Telugu support (Issue #3)
5. **Week 5**: Update UI for multi-language (Issue #5)

## Quick Start

To begin fixing the transliteration:

1. **Read Issue #0** for the complete execution plan
2. **Start with Issue #1** to fix the core algorithm
3. **Follow the dependency chain** as outlined in the master plan
4. **Test each phase** before moving to the next

## Success Criteria

The project is successful when:

- ‚úÖ "namaste" ‚Üí "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á" in Hindi
- ‚úÖ "namaste" ‚Üí "‡∞®‡∞Æ‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞§‡±á" in Telugu
- ‚úÖ Language switching works seamlessly
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality is preserved
- ‚úÖ Performance meets benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Architecture is ready for additional languages

## Issue Tracking

We have a built-in issue tracking system to help manage progress:

```bash
# List all issues and their status
./scripts/issue-tracker.sh list

# Check specific issue status
./scripts/issue-tracker.sh status [issue_number]

# Update issue status (start, review, complete, block)
./scripts/issue-tracker.sh [command] [issue_number]
```

See [TRACKING_README.md](TRACKING_README.md) for complete usage instructions.

## Contributing

When working on these issues:

1. **Follow the execution order** - don't skip dependencies
2. **Update issue status** - use the tracking system to show progress
3. **Test thoroughly** - each fix should improve quality
4. **Update tests** - ensure regression prevention
5. **Document changes** - help future contributors
