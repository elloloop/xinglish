- **Title**: Transliteration Algorithm Overhaul
- **Status**: 🔴 NOT STARTED
- **Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Assignee**: [TBD]

## Problem
The current transliteration algorithm produces poor quality results:
- **Input**: "namaste" 
- **Current Output**: "नअमअसतए" (letter-by-letter transliteration)
- **Expected Output**: "नमस्ते" (proper Hindi word)

## Root Cause Analysis
The current algorithm has several fundamental flaws:

1. **Character-by-character processing**: It transliterates each letter individually without understanding Hindi phonetics
2. **No syllable awareness**: Hindi is a syllabic language, but the algorithm doesn't recognize syllable boundaries
3. **Missing phonetic rules**: Many important Hindi phonetic patterns are not implemented
4. **No context awareness**: The algorithm doesn't consider surrounding characters or word context
5. **Incorrect vowel handling**: Hindi has inherent vowels and vowel signs (matras), but the current approach treats all vowels the same

## Current Algorithm Flow
```
"namaste" → split into characters → [n, a, m, a, s, t, e]
→ transliterate each: n→न, a→अ, m→म, a→अ, s→स, t→त, e→ए
→ result: "नअमअसतए"
```

## Required Algorithm Flow
```
"namaste" → analyze syllables → [na, ma, ste]
→ apply phonetic rules: na→न, ma→म, ste→स्ते
→ result: "नमस्ते"
```

## Impact
- **High Priority**: This is the core functionality and current results are unusable
- **User Experience**: Users cannot rely on the transliteration for actual communication
- **Credibility**: Poor quality undermines the entire project's value proposition

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational issue)

## Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 3-4 days
- **Testing**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: 5-6 days

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "namaste" correctly transliterates to "नमस्ते"
- [ ] "kaise ho aap" correctly transliterates to "कैसे हो आप"
- [ ] All test cases in `test-core.js` pass with correct Hindi output
- [ ] Confidence scores accurately reflect transliteration quality
- [ ] Performance remains under 100ms for typical word lengths

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Documentation
- [ ] Code comments added
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] API documentation updated

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Issue status updated to ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Linked to dependent issues (#2, #4)

## Notes
This is the foundational issue that must be completed before any other issues can proceed.
